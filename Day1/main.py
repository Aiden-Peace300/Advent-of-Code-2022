# Prompt:
# Santa's reindeer typically eat regular reindeer food, but they need
# a lot of magical energy to deliver presents on Christmas. For that,
# their favorite snack is a special type of star fruit that only grows
# deep in the jungle. The Elves have brought you on their annual expedition
# to the grove where the fruit grows.
#
# The Elves take turns writing down the number of Calories contained by the
# various meals, snacks, rations, etc. that they've brought with them, one
# item per line. Each Elf separates their own inventory from the previous
# Elf's inventory (if any) by a blank line.
# For example, suppose the Elves finish writing their items'
# Calories and end up with the following list:
# 1000
# 2000
# 3000
#
# 4000
#
# 5000
# 6000
#
# 7000
# 8000
# 9000
#
# 10000
#
# This list represents the Calories of the food carried by five Elves:
#
#   - The first Elf is carrying food with 1000, 2000, and 3000 Calories, a total of 6000 Calories.
#   - The second Elf is carrying one food item with 4000 Calories.
#   - The third Elf is carrying food with 5000 and 6000 Calories, a total of 11000 Calories.
#   - The fourth Elf is carrying food with 7000, 8000, and 9000 Calories, a total of 24000 Calories.
#   - The fifth Elf is carrying one food item with 10000 Calories.
#
# In case the Elves get hungry and need extra snacks, they need to know which Elf to.
# ask: they'd like to know how many Calories are being carried by the Elf carrying
# the most Calories. In the example above, this is 24000 (carried by the fourth Elf).
#
# Find the Elf carrying the most Calories. How many total Calories is that Elf carrying?
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Aiden's Algo:
# - read from file
# - count up calories of each elf til you reach empty line
# - calc EACH elf's calories
# - compare current elf's calories to last elf's calories
# - save the elfs with the most calories.
# - print the elf with the most calories to console/terminal.
#

    else:
        # calc EACH elf's calories
        each_elf_sum_of_calories += int(line)

# checking to see if last elf's calories was larger than the last
# we have to do this because the last elf won't have a '' behind it
# in the list of 'list_of_cals' so we have to check to see if the
# elf's calories sum is larger than the last elf's calories sum
