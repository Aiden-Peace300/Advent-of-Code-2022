# Prompt:
# The Elves begin to set up camp on the beach. To decide whose tent gets to be closest to the snack
# storage, a giant Rock Paper Scissors tournament is already in progress.
#
# Rock Paper Scissors is a game between two players. Each game contains many rounds; in each round,
# the players each simultaneously choose one of Rock, Paper, or Scissors using a hand shape. Then,
# a winner for that round is selected: Rock defeats Scissors, Scissors defeats Paper, and Paper
# defeats Rock. If both players choose the same shape, the round instead ends in a draw.
#
# Appreciative of your help yesterday, one Elf gives you an encrypted strategy guide
# (your puzzle input) that they say will be sure to help you win. "The first column is what
# your opponent is going to play: A for Rock, B for Paper, and C for Scissors. The second
# column--" Suddenly, the Elf is called away to help with someone's tent.
#
# The second column, you reason, must be what you should play in response: X for Rock, Y for Paper,
# and Z for Scissors. Winning every time would be suspicious, so the responses must have been
# carefully chosen.
#
# The winner of the whole tournament is the player with the highest score. Your total score is the
# sum of your scores for each round. The score for a single round is the score for the shape you
# selected (1 for Rock, 2 for Paper, and 3 for Scissors) plus the score for the outcome of the
# round (0 if you lost, 3 if the round was a draw, and 6 if you won).
#
# Since you can't be sure if the Elf is trying to help you or trick you, you should calculate
# the score you would get if you were to follow the strategy guide.
#
# For example, suppose you were given the following strategy guide:
#
# A Y
# B X
# C Z
# This strategy guide predicts and recommends the following:
#
#   - In the first round, your opponent will choose Rock (A), 4, and
#     you should choose Paper (Y). This ends in a win for
#     you with a score of 8 (2 because you chose Paper + 6
#     because you won).
#   - In the second round, your opponent will choose Paper (B), and
#     you should choose Rock (X). This ends in a loss for you with
#     a score of 1 (1 + 0).
#   - The third round is a draw with both players choosing
#     Scissors, giving you a score of 3 + 3 = 6.
#
# In this example, if you were to follow the strategy guide, you would get a total score of 15 (8 + 1 + 6).
# What would your total score be if everything goes exactly according to your strategy guide? ->
